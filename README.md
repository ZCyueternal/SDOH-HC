XXX demo on MIRFlickr dataset.

Paper : XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

This is a simplified demo, including:  
train.m: function to compute the hash code and hash function of training data.    
mAP.m : function to compute the mAP of hashing method.  
Kernelize.m: function to transform the original features to kernel features.  
main_demo.m: example script to run the code on the MIRFLickr dataset.
